# Native Click Sound Cordova Plugin For Android

## Installation
### Prerequsites
This must be compiled at Android API level 21 or higher which means you'll have to be using cordova-android v3.7.1 or higher.
The latest version of cordova-cli does not use cordova-android 3.7.1, so to manually install run the following:
``` bash
cordova platform remove android
cordova platform add android@3.7.1
```
