# Native Click Sound Cordova Plugin

* Now with support for iOS and Android *

Just specify an array of class strings and on an onclick event, it will trigger the default click sound for the platform. Also you can trigger the click sound manually.

Android part based on a blog post from [@pieterderycke](https://pieterderycke.wordpress.com/2014/01/20/native-tick-sound-on-button-click-with-phonegap/)

## Installation

``` bash
cordova plugin add https://github.com/MatiMenich/cordova-plugin-nativeClickSound
```

## Usage

```js
var clickyClasses = ['sound-click', 'button']; 

nativeclick.watch(clickyClasses);
```

Also, you cant trigger the click sound:

```js
nativeclick.trigger();
```

If you're using angular for example:

```html
<!-- In the view -->
<button ng-click="click()"></button>
```

```js
// In the controller
$scope.click = function() {
  nativeclick.trigger();
};
```
